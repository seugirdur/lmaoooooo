I'm a person who hates endings
And I can usually guess them all
It tires me before it's even over
But give me the certainty that I won't be disappointed
So I go there and create mine
My endings always full of beginnings
An ending where nothing is the way I want it
But it's predictable. It's full of the signs that people give and don't notice. It's full of the retold past.
The only thing that is the same and also different in all of them is me
Who's so sure she's not wrong that she'd rather get hurt soon
Who knows his next act and prefers not to be hostage to something that always comes to an end
And that the end it creates comes faster and hurts, but soon it passes, soon it becomes a memory
I need this ending soon, sooner than I thought
Being the one who leaves hurts
But I can't be the one who waits
No more
And I can't let you stay either
'Cause even if someday I come back, I'm not that girl you fell in love with
I never went
I am the girl who hurt you
The girl who was too much in a terrible way
And the girl you'd hate if we had more time
I'm still the girl you'll hate
But not for the expected reason
And yes that's why
For not letting it go away little by little but all at once
Because you stayed right where I left you
I can't apologize for that
Not when I'm leaving
Not when I know you won't terrorize my "what ifs" anymore
Not when I'm pretty sure running away is the right thing
But I know she'll sew the tapestry I've torn apart
And you won't remember how troubled I am
'Cause you'll see it all start again
