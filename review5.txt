I didn't think it was fair
could have read your thoughts if
you'll never read all the confusions in lines
that I wrote about myself
and also about you
so here will be this first, last and only
piece of mine

these are things i can only write
when I still haven't gotten up or dressed
so I can start to stop thinking about me
It's the moment when questions like what do I want to be or what do I need to improve don't appear
there is only one question left:
Why what makes me happy
can't go on forever?

I don't want you to blame yourself
thinking you broke something
what you healed was so much more
you will not be able to understand in depth
what exactly did it mean to me
all those little moments
you might not remember every one of them
but it's ok
is that so
we rock the lives of the people around us
without even realizing
That's why every day we wake up and make such an effort to deliver our best version of ourselves.

little by little, questions like
"perhaps if I had been a little more polite"
"if only I had been a little less annoying"
will go away
It's been a month since I stopped looking for news about you and what you were doing
it's just that I knew but didn't want to believe
that when it's over, everything will go back to normal
and everyone will be fine

i hope you are still writing
since this is our way of expressing who we are
but also in case it ever hurts you
I hope you take a break, just like I did
because that will never replace spending time with someone

tomorrow
we will wake up one more time
let's have coffee
brushing teeth
eat when it's time
and respect when it's time to stop
the rest? we improvise
as always was

I will take my road
maybe you blink and I'm already on the other side of the globe
but you won't know
I didn't even know how to count
but I won't forget what you said to me every time we said goodbye
as much as the final goodbye is a little later, it's better to talk now and leave it eternal.

take care.
