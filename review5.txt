I was told you were inside my messy room with boxes and boxes of things I never had the courage to open.

But the truth is I saw you more like a visitor
That arrived and made me forget everything
(Although I never forgot, I just ignored)

I never allowed you to get too close to the mess and when that was about to happen I would just kick you out without explanation
And you'd come back the other day, knocking on the door and hoping I'd let you in again

Every time I said goodbye to you, I knew that room was what awaited me and everything was very, very confusing
But you know, I think I'm fine with that now
I'm fine seeing this doubt coming to an end

I'm good to see you leaving for good
I'm fine with letting our story (or what could one day come to it) end with a random spot in the middle of a book, on a cloudy Tuesday.
I'm fine being alone and dealing with that room for good

I'm fine and I think you are too.
I expect.
